## Contributing to Mnesiac

I welcome any and all ideas, issues and pull requests. Be sure to follow git best practices. A couple of ground rules:

- All code must be formatted.
- All code must be documented.
- All code must pass static analysis/linter checks.
- All code must have test coverage.

Exceptions should be avoided whenever possible.
