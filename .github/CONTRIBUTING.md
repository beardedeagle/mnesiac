## Contributing to Mnesiac

I welcome any and all ideas, issues and pull requests. Be sure to follow git best practices. A couple of ground rules:

- All code must be formatted, when applicable.
- All code must be documented, when applicable.
- All code must pass static analysis/linter checks, when applicable.
- All code must have test coverage, when applicable.

Exceptions should be avoided whenever possible.
