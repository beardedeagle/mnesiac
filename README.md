Mnesia auto clustering made easy!

Docs can be found at [https://hexdocs.pm/mnesiac](https://hexdocs.pm/mnesiac).

**_NOTICE:_** This fork is intended to be used only in projects that are using libcluster

**_NOTICE:_** Mnesiac, while stable, is still considered pre `1.0`. This means the API can, and may, change at any time. Please ensure you review the docs and changelog prior to updating.

**_NOTICE:_** Mnesiac allows a significant amount of freedom with how it behaves. This allows you to customize Mnesiac to suit your needs. However, this also allows for a fair amount of foot gunning. Please ensure you've done your due diligence when using this library, or Mnesia itself for that matter. It isn't a silver bullet, and it shouldn't be treated as one.

## Installation

Simply add `mnesiac` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:mnesiac, "~> 0.3"}
  ]
end
```

Edit your app's config.exs to add the list of Mnesia stores:

```elixir
config :mnesiac,
  stores: [MyApp.ExampleStore, ...],
  schema_type: :disc_copies, # defaults to :ram_copies
  table_load_timeout: 600_000 # milliseconds, default is 600_000
```

Then add `mnesiac` to your supervision tree:

- **_EXAMPLE:_** With `libcluster` using the `Cluster.Strategy.Epmd` strategy:

```elixir
  ...

    topology = Application.get_env(:libcluster, :topologies)
    hosts = topology[:myapp][:config][:hosts]

    children = [
      {Cluster.Supervisor, [topology, [name: MyApp.ClusterSupervisor]]},
      {Mnesiac.Supervisor, [hosts, [name: MyApp.MnesiacSupervisor]]},
      ...
    ]

  ...
```

- **_EXAMPLE:_** Without `libcluster`:

```elixir
  ...

    children = [
      {
        Mnesiac.Supervisor,
        [
          [:"test01@127.0.0.1", :"test02@127.0.0.1"],
          [name: MyApp.MnesiacSupervisor]
        ]
      },
      ...
    ]

  ...
```

## Usage

### Table creation

Create a table store, `use Mnesiac.Store`, and add it to your app's config.exs.

All stores **_MUST_** implement its own `store_options/0`, which returns a keyword list of store options.

There are three optional callbacks which can be implemented:

- `init_store/0`, which allows users to implement custom store initialization logic. Triggered by Mnesiac.
- `copy_store/0`, which allows users to implement a custom call to copy a store. Triggered by Mnesiac.
- `resolve_conflict/1`, which allows a user to implement logic when Mnesiac detects a store with records on both the local and remote Mnesia cluster node. Triggered by Mnesiac. Default is to do nothing.

**_MINIMAL EXAMPLE:_**

```elixir
defmodule MyApp.ExampleStore do
  @moduledoc """
  Provides the structure of ExampleStore records for a minimal example of Mnesiac.
  """
  use Mnesiac.Store
  import Record, only: [defrecord: 3]

  @doc """
  Record definition for ExampleStore example record.
  """
  defrecord(
    :example,
    __MODULE__,
    id: nil,
    topic_id: nil,
    event: nil
  )

  @typedoc """
  ExampleStore example record field type definitions.
  """
  @type example ::
          record(
            :example,
            id: String.t(),
            topic_id: String.t(),
            event: String.t()
          )

  @impl true
  def store_options,
    do: [
      record_name: :example,
      attributes: example() |> example() |> Keyword.keys(),
      index: [:topic_id],
      ram_copies: [node()]
    ]
end
```

### Clustering

If you are using `libcluster` or another clustering library, ensure that the clustering library starts before `mnesiac`. That's all, you don't need to do anything else.

If you are not using `libcluster` or similar clustering libraries then:

- When a node joins to an erlang/elixir cluster, run the `Mnesiac.init_mnesia/1` function on the **_new node_**. This will initialize and copy the store contents from the other online nodes in the Mnesia cluster.

## Development

Ensure you have the proper language versions installed. To do this, an `asdf` tools file has been provided. Run the following:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/beardedeagle/mnesiac.git
git checkout -b MyFeature
asdf install
mix local.hex --force
mix local.rebar --force
mix deps.get --force
mix deps.compile --force
mix compile --force
```

**_NOTICE:_** You can find the `asdf` tool [here][1].

## Testing

Before you run any tests, ensure that you have cleaned up Mnesia:

```shell
mix purge.db
```

Test results and coverage reports are generated by running the following:

```shell
mix coveralls.html --trace --slowest 10 --no-start
```

## Notice

This library was built standing on the shoulders of giants. A big thanks goes out to Mustafa Turan. The original library this was forked from can be found here: <https://github.com/mustafaturan/mnesiam>.

Happy coding!
